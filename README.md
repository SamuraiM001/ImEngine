# ImEngine


ImEngine is a lightweight and powerful game engine designed for efficient game development. It consists of a core engine and an integrated editor, with a focus on flexibility and ease of use.  

## Core Engine

The core of ImEngine is where the main logic of the engine happens. This includes the handling of:

- Main game logic
- Rendering layers management
- Runtime operations  
It is designed to be fast, scalable, and flexible for various game development needs.

## Editor

The ImEngine editor is where you'll interact with your game during development. It has two main render layers:

1. **Game Render Layer:** This layer renders the game itself in "Editor Mode." It lets you preview the game in real-time while you work on it.
2. **GUI Render Layer:** Powered by **ImGui**, this layer renders the editor's interface, making it easy to manipulate the game, adjust settings, and manage assets.

Both layers work seamlessly to provide an intuitive and productive development experience.

## Project Manager (Coming Soon)

The upcoming **Project Manager** feature will allow you to easily manage your game projects within ImEngine. With this tool, you will be able to:

- Select and open existing projects
- Create and manage new projects
- Organize your projects for easier access and management

Stay tuned for its release!
